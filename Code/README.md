Simple hello world code to show a .NET connection to InterSystems IRIS

## IDE

We recommend to run this sample .NET code with [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads). 

## How to run

1. First, launch the Microsoft Visual Studio.
2. Select **View** > **Team Explorer**
3. Under the *Local Git Repository*, select **Clone** command 
4. Enter `https://github.com/intersystems/Samples-dotnet-helloworld` and click **Clone** button
5. Open `HelloWorld.cs` and modify the `IP` and `password` to be the correct values for your InterSystems IRIS instance. `Port` and `username` are most likely the defaults but you can verify those as well.
6. Run the code and verify you see **"Hello World! You have successfully connected to InterSystems IRIS. Press any key to continue."** as the output.
